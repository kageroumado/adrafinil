/// Claude Code: `~/.claude/settings.json`, `UserPromptSubmit` → acquire, `Stop` → release.
///
/// **Activity-scoped, not session-scoped.** An earlier version wired `SessionStart`/`SessionEnd`,
/// which held a sleep block for the *entire* session — including all the time it sat idle at the
/// prompt waiting for input. Claude Code instead brackets each working turn: `UserPromptSubmit`
/// fires when a prompt is submitted and `Stop` fires when the agent finishes responding
/// (`reason: 'completed'` in the query loop). Acquiring/releasing on those means the Mac is only
/// kept awake while the agent is actually working, and an open-but-idle session lets it sleep.
///
/// An Esc-interrupt is the one turn-end that fires no `Stop` (the abort short-circuits it), and Claude
/// Code has no interrupt hook. The reliable catch is the daemon's CPU-idle sweep — an interrupted
/// session's process tree drops to ~idle, and the sweep releases it after the idle window. The third
/// hook here, `Notification` matched to `idle_prompt`, is a *best-effort fast-path*: when Claude does
/// emit its "waiting for your input" notification it releases sooner, but that notification is gated
/// by version/focus/notification-channel and often doesn't fire, so it is not relied upon. The
/// process-exit watcher covers a terminal closed mid-turn. None of these need a session-end hook.
///
/// Claude Code is the only agent that also exposes a real session-id env var to hooks —
/// `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` (verified against 2.1.158; *not* `CLAUDE_SESSION_ID`, which expands
/// empty). The CLI still prefers the `session_id` field from the hook's stdin JSON; the env-var
/// positional is a fallback. The same session id keys both hooks, so multi-turn sessions cycle
/// acquire→release→acquire on one idempotent key.
///
/// **Sub-agents.** A backgrounded sub-agent (`Task`/workflow) keeps running after the parent turn's
/// `Stop`, which would release the turn hold and let the Mac sleep mid-work. Claude Code emits
/// `SubagentStart`/`SubagentStop` for these, carrying the parent's `session_id` and the sub-agent's
/// own id in a separate `agent_id` field (verified in `src/utils/hooks.ts`). So those two hooks use
/// the `--subagent` acquire/release, which key on `agent_id` — a distinct `<tool>:<agent_id>` hold
/// that survives the parent `Stop` and releases only on that sub-agent's own `SubagentStop`. Keying
/// them on `session_id` instead would drop the parent's turn hold the moment a foreground sub-agent
/// finished. The sub-agent hold has the parent's PID attached (sub-agents are in-process), so the
/// daemon's CPU-idle / dead-process nets still cover a missed `SubagentStop`.
